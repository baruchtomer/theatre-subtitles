ROTEM: Hi, we're about to start... thank you for coming... 
we have a very festive evening today, we have four segments from different shows. Amazing ones. 
We just have a small technical issue... everything's fine, but we'll start in a moment.

ROTEM: Sorry friends. Just one more minute and we'll start. 

Shachar... listen... good thing you're answering really... there's a problem... we have 
almost everything... everything's ready, yes, we have characters, we have actresses, 
we have set design, we have text, but... there's no music! Something happened to the music... 
What happened? What happened?? Don't ask what happened! Lightning struck the equipment truck 
and burned the computer with all the music from the shows and there's no backup in the entire world 
except with a Chinese monk who lives on top of a lonely mountain and only answers the phone on Tuesdays! 
And today is Sunday! Shachar, I don't know what to do... there's no music, none! no music! none! No music! 
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do all the audience is here and...

ROTEM: Excuse me, hi, what's your name? \n TOMER: Tomer \n ROTEM: Ah how cosmic, Tomer and Rotem have the same letters 
hahahaha... and you? \n TOMER: That's Regev, my brother. We're the Baruch brothers, 
listen we're right in the middle... I don't know if you noticed 
ROTEM: Great great... the Baruch brothers. Do you know how to make music for plays too or just this samba thing? 
Just don't ask, we have four segments here... \nTOMER: Listen, I don't know what you're talking about... 
we agreed with Shachar on three pieces for the reception, we're leaving soon... 
ROTEM: Okay okay I understand you only know how to make elevator music I got it... \n TOMER: Absolutely not
